Hey hey!
It's thecist here

I got huge plans for the website but in the meantime I want to build a habit of updating the website everyday
So I'll be talking about my day to day experience. I mostly spend my time in my dorm or the library so don't expect any thrilling social encounter but I'll gosh about the newest tech I found or a good youtube video I watched or how I solved a leetcode problem.

Maybe buy a plant? I have to learn how to be responsible at some point and having a pet seems like a really risky first decision.

I've been really lazy today, only solving a leetcode problem and dealing with some school stuffs but hopefully I'll get things sorted out by the time I make my extension(It's going to force me to be productive everyday... somehow)

I also desperately need some commit hooks lol, I almost typed my name

### Things to do
- Commit hook to check for no no words and current account
- Integration of an existing regression testing framework
- Creation of custom regression testing framework for practice

I've been both busy and lazy. It's annoying but this week will be better. I also have to push my extension up the list. I really need a way to hold myself accountable, fast.

```
When the website/app/extension load, it should be extremely fast so I can easily add text to it
```

I'm also currently learning vim, I was told I won't be insufferable once I'm done(that's arch) but I really need to pick up speed.
