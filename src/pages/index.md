Hey!

I&#8217;ll be thecist for as long as I can, and hopefully stay anonymous

Hosting a website was more of a spur-in-the-moment thing but I&#8217;m also dangerously in love with web development. I can spend days on it without noticing and once spent my whole summer learning React and Threejs with nothing else and probably 5 conversations. I had some money so I said, why not?

I need a way to express myself, try things without critiquing myself, start and dump projects based on how I feel, and most importantly grow, both as a web developer and a person, so this is what thecist will beâ€“ a janky passionate project from an anonymous developer with a lot of flaws.

Hopefully, things don&#8217;t get personal as I&#8217;d love to build a community with strangers sharing similar passions as me.
