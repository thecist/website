# What will the blog page be about
Blog will be focused on projects I work on along with some tidbits about my experience working on them

I'll get into as much details as I can along with recording videos/audious and showing diagrams with excalidraw. Most of the blogs on my projects will be on features I implement on this website but occasionally there might be come projects I work on that are not part of the website.

## Another Section (Too lazy to name it)

Some projects I'll be working on will include
- A custom made regression testing framework
- Writing a custom script to switch git profiles on a machine
- A custom markdown parser
- A custom markdown flavor for this website
- A framework to link bits and pieces of my life with different blogs
- Integrations with Notion
- Integrations with Discord
- A custom web browser extension
- Using typescript for a year and then gain the title of a professional hater by writing articles on it
- Designing the UI of the website (blue is a must)
