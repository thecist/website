Hey hey!
It&#8217;s thecist here

I got huge plans for the website but in the meantime I want to build a habit of updating the website everyday
So I&#8217;ll be talking about my day to day experience. I mostly spend my time in my dorm or the library so don&#8217;t expect any thrilling social encounter but I&#8217;ll gosh about the newest tech I found or a good youtube video I watched or how I solved a leetcode problem.

Maybe buy a plant? I have to learn how to be responsible at some point and having a pet seems like a really risky first decision.

I&#8217;ve been really lazy today, only solving a leetcode problem and dealing with some school stuffs but hopefully I&#8217;ll get things sorted out by the time I make my extension(It&#8217;s going to force me to be productive everyday... somehow)

I also desperately need some commit hooks lol, I almost typed my name

### Things to do
- Commit hook to check for no no words and current account
- Integration of an existing regression testing framework
- Creation of custom regression testing framework for practice

I&#8217;ve been both busy and lazy. It&#8217;s annoying but this week will be better. I also have to push my extension up the list. I really need a way to hold myself accountable, fast.

```
When the website/app/extension load, it should be extremely fast so I can easily add text to it
```

I&#8217;m also currently learning vim, I was told I won&#8217;t be insufferable once I&#8217;m done(that&#8217;s arch) but I really need to pick up speed.

Famous last words lol.

I really need to be consistent, so many things to do
Alright let&#8217;s do this

### About an hour later
I had a call with my boss(for my internship) and added some checks to prevent dumb mistakes. I&#8217;ll work on deploying what I have currently to thecist and then work on adding a regression testing pipeline.

```
I probably should prevent pushing and commiting on the same line using &&

Future me if you&#8217;re reading this please figure out a smart way or just stop. What&#8217;s the point of the check if you&#8217;re going to push anyways?
```

I just deployed my website and found a problem with the apostrophe
- Create a git action that replaces all apostrophe with `&#8217;` before commiting
- Create a better system to dump all the todo's in my face so I actually work on them when I visit the site
- Make the site something I have to visit more often
- Change the default url with the thecist.dev url bought

I've been gone for a week, that's a long time. I've been busy getting my boxes from my mum's friend, school and an internship. But most of all I have a hard time sticking to a schedule. I've decided to prioritise creating an extension over an online markdown editor for my blogs and journal.

I should hopefully have something rudimentary working by the end of the week
